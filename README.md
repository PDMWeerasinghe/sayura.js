Sayura.js
=========

*Javascript implementation of Sayura transliteration scheme*

With sayura.js you can have the ease of [sayura](http://www.sayura.net/im/) sinhala phonetic input method's awesomeness pretty much anywhere.

Annoyances (I'd hopefully fix)
----------
* ~~you don't feel like you are typing in sinhala! (sinhala shows up in different div)~~
* Currently You can't go back to a place in text and edit there.
* ~~Line breaks don't do anything in sinhala text.~~
* ~~Chrome refuse to render sinhala text properly.~~

Demo
-----
I put it in my dropbox and [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/362794/sayurajs-inplace/sayura.html) it is.

*Thank you [Anuradha](https://twitter.com/the_hobbit) and everyone who worked on Sayura ever.*

Yada yada
---------
I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 and realized there is no ibus-sayura build for it.
That's not the only reason for writing this. I was working on a 
[transliterator for tripitaka text](https://github.com/chanux/metta-transliterator)
and had plans to port it JS too. I thought implementing sayura.js would be a good 
excercise before actually give a go at it. Also sayura.js will be helpful when I'm not
at my fine setup :)

My JS is rusty. I never properly learned the language (hi jQuery!). So the code may look
funny and fugly at places.
