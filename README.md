Sayura.js
=========

*Javascript implementation of Sayura transliteration scheme*

With sayura.js you can have the ease of [sayura](http://www.sayura.net/im/) sinhala phonetic input method's awesomeness pretty much anywhere.

Annoyances (I'd hopefully fix)
----------
* You can't go back to a place in text and edit there.
* If you type fast enough sayurajs will fall behind. 

How to use?
----------
Add sayura to your page
Set 'sayuraInput' as the id for any input, textarea element.

Or

Just add sayura to your page, do nothing more and have all input, textarea elements sayurafied.

Check sayura.html for an example. 

Demo

I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 and realized there is no ibus-sayura build for it.
That's not the only reason for writing this. I was working on a 
[transliterator for tripitaka text](https://github.com/chanux/metta-transliterator)
and had plans to port it ot JS too. I thought implementing sayura.js would be a good 
excercise before actually giving it a go. Also sayura.js will be helpful when I'm not
at my fine setup :)

My JS is rusty. I never properly learned the language (hi jQuery!). So the code may look
funny and fugly at places.
