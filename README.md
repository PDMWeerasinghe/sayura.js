Javascript implementation of Sayura transliteration scheme
==========================================================

I am a fan of [sayura input method](http://www.sayura.net/im/).
It makes typing sinhala so much easier for me. This is a close but not complete (yet!)
JS implementation of Sayura transliteration scheme. It's not complete but it's usable.

My JS is rusty. I never properly learned the language (hi jQuery!). So the code may look
funny to a JS dude. Also this was done in a hurry. So the code is guaranteed to be fugly.
I'll clean it up and complete the handful of missing tid bits.

There's quite a bit of space for improvement. Hopefully I won't get bored of this soon.

Backstory
---------
I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 and realized there is no ibus-sayura build for it.
That's not th only reason for writing this. I was working on a 
[transliterator for tripitaka text](https://github.com/chanux/metta-transliterator)
and had plans to port it JS too. I thought implementing sayura.js would be a good 
excercise before actually give a go at it. Also sayura.js will be helpful when I'm not
at my fine setup :)

Demo
-----
I put it in my dropbox and [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/362794/sayura.js/sayura.html) it is.

*Thank you [Anuradha](https://twitter.com/the_hobbit) and everyone who worked on Sayura ever.*
